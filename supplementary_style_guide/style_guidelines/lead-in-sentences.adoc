= Lead-in sentences

A lead-in sentenece is the text that directly follows a procedure or prerequiste heading in a task-based module. It is not the module abstract, which describes the goals of the user for the module.

A lead-in sentence immediately precedes the first step in a procedure and is in the form of "To do something...:".

Avoid using a lead-in sentence if it does not add value. Use a lead-in sentence to introduce a procedure or prerequisite only in instances where the lead-in sentence adds context and makes it easier for the user to understand the module content.
