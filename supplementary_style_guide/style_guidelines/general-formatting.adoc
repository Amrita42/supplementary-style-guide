[[date-formats]]
== Date formats

Follow _The IBM Style Guide_  guidance of _day Month year_ for date formats, for example 3 October 2019.

When the format _day Month year_ causes a presentation or clarity issue, use instead: _Month day, year_ (for example, October 3, 2019).


[[user-replaced-values]]
== User-replaced values

A _user-replaced value_ is a value that the user must replace with a value that is relevant for their situation. User-replaced values are often found in places such as code blocks, file paths, and commands.

Use descriptive names for user-replaced values and follow this general format: _<value_name>_.

Ensure that user-replaced values have the following characteristics:

* Surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`)
* Separated by underscores (`_`) for multi-word values
* Lowercase, unless the rest of the related text is uppercase or another capitalization scheme.
* Italicized
* If the user-replaced value is referencing a value in code or in a command that is normally monospace, also use monospace for the user-replaced value.

----
Create an Ansible inventory file that is named `/_<path>_/inventory/hosts`.
----

This renders as follows:

====
Create an Ansible inventory file that is named `/_<path>_/inventory/hosts`.
====

To italicize a user-replaced value in a code block, you must add an attribute to apply text formatting, such as `subs="+quotes"` or `subs="normal"`, to the attribute list of the code block.

  [subs="+quotes"]
  ----
  $ oc describe node __<node_name>__

This renders as follows:

[[admonitions]]
== Admonitions

Admonitions should draw the readerâ€™s attention to certain information. Keep admonitions to a minimum, and avoid placing multiple admonitions in close proximity to one another. If multiple admonitions are necessary, restructure the information by removing the less important statements and placing them into the flow of the main content.

Valid admonition types:

- NOTE
- IMPORTANT
- WARNING
- TIP

[IMPORTANT]
====
CAUTION, which is another type of AsciiDoc admonition, is not fully supported by the Red Hat Customer Portal. Do not use this admonition type.
====

Admonitions should be short and concise. Do not include procedures in an admonition.

Only individual admonitions are allowed. For example, you cannot have a plural *NOTES* heading.

----
[NOTE]
====
Text for note.
