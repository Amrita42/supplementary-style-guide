== Date formats

Follow _The IBM Style Guide_  guidance of `day Month year` for date formats, for example 3 October 2019.

When the format, `day Month year`, causes a presentation or clarity issue, use instead: `Month day, year` (for example, October 3, 2019). (Issue link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/supplementary-style-guide/issues/14[#14])
