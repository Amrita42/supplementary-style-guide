[[date-formats]]
== Date formats

Follow _The IBM Style Guide_  guidance of _day Month year_ for date formats, for example, 3 October 2019.

When the format _day Month year_ causes a presentation or clarity issue, use _Month day, year_ (for example, October 3, 2019) instead.


[[user-replaced-values]]
== User-replaced values

A _user-replaced value_ is a value that the user must replace with a value that is relevant for their situation. User-replaced values are often found in places such as code blocks, file paths, and commands.

Use descriptive names for user-replaced values and follow this general format: _<value_name>_.

Ensure that user-replaced values have the following characteristics:

* Surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`)
* Separated by underscores (`_`) for multi-word values
* Lowercase, unless the rest of the related text is uppercase or another capitalization scheme
* Italicized
* If the user-replaced value is referencing a value in code or in a command that is normally monospace, also use monospace for the user-replaced value.

.Example AsciiDoc: User-replaced value in a paragraph

----
Create an Ansible inventory file that is named `/_<path>_/inventory/hosts`.
----

This renders as:

====
Create an Ansible inventory file that is named `/_<path>_/inventory/hosts`.
====

To italicize a user-replaced value in a code block, you must add an attribute to apply text formatting, such as `subs="+quotes"` or `subs="normal"`, to the attribute list of the code block.

  [subs="+quotes"]

  $ oc describe node __<node_name>__

This renders as:

[[lead-in-sentences]]
== Lead-in sentences for `Prerequisites` and `Procedure` sections

A lead-in sentence in this context is the text that directly follows a `Prerequisites` or `Procedure` heading in a task-based module. It is distinct from the module abstract, which describes the goals of the user for the module.

Do not use a lead-in sentence in the `Prerequisites` or `Procedure` sections of a module unless it is necessary to aid navigation or add clarity.

The following examples demonstrate when a lead-in sentence might add value.

* Your module has a long list of prerequisites, and you want to group the prerequisties in sections to make it easier for users to understand what tasks must be performed to complete a procedure.
* Your module has a complex procedure or set of prerequisites, and you want to emphasize that all steps or prerequisites must be completed.

Use a complete sentence for the lead-in sentence to reduce ambiguity and support translation.

[[admonitions]]
== Admonitions

Admonitions should draw the readerâ€™s attention to certain information. Keep admonitions to a minimum, and avoid placing multiple admonitions close to one another. If multiple admonitions are necessary, restructure the information by moving the less-important statements into the flow of the main content.

Valid admonition types:

- NOTE
- IMPORTANT
- WARNING
- TIP

[IMPORTANT]
====
CAUTION, which is another type of AsciiDoc admonition, is not fully supported by the Red Hat Customer Portal. Do not use this admonition type.
====

Admonitions should be short and concise. Do not include procedures in an admonition.

Only individual admonitions are allowed, for example, you cannot have a plural *NOTES* heading.

== Product names and version references

correct sequence when combining attributes

syntax recommendations: what separators to use? dashes/hyphens, underscores?
////

Whenever you refer to the name of your product in full, or in its abbreviated form, or when you refer to the major and minor version of your product, avoid using hard-coded references and use attributes instead.

Only use hard-coded version references if the version that you are referring to in a particular case never changes.

=== Attribute file

Define attributes for product name and product version in a single common shared attributes file for each documentation set or product.

Name the file `attributes.adoc`.
You may use a different name if necessary, but if you do, ensure that the name of the file indicates to your collaborators that it is an attribute file.

//For a single title, store the file in the same directory as the `master.adoc` file.
For sharing between multiple titles, store the file in a common directory above the directories that contain your titles, such as `docs/common/` or `docs/topics/templates`.

Include the attributes file at the beginning of the `master.adoc` files of all titles in your documentation set:

.master.adoc
[source,asciidoc,options="nowrap"]
----
\include::common/attributes.adoc[]
----

TIP: Create a symbolic link pointing to the `common` directory inside the directory containing the `master.adoc` file of your title. It makes including the attribute file in your title easier. +
Do not copy the directory or attribute file directly, and do not use hard links!

=== Minimum required attributes

For each title ensure that you define attributes for the following values:

* product name
* abbreviated product name (if applicable to your product)
* the major and minor version of the product (for example, 5 and 5.4)

You may create additional attributes according to what your documentation requires.
For example, some projects with complex names may define multiple abbreviated and non-abbreviated forms for their product name. You may also combine existing product name attributes to create compound product names.

=== Attribute usage

Product names and abbreviations::
Use the product name attribute for all instances of the product name where possible.
Avoid using hard-coded product names.

Product versions::
Use the product version attribute for instances where the product version should change with the next version and the content would still be correct.
Do not use the product version attribute if the version should not change.
For example, if a feature was introduced in a certain version, the version should be hard-coded.

////
=== Recommendations on attribute name syntax

The particular format of attribute names is largely determined by the internal naming conventions of each particular project.

Some recommendation can be made to the general syntax of attribute names to ensure that the names clearly indicate the purpose of each attribute.

Attribute names should be as explicit as possible, especially in sets that have many attributes.
Using prefixes helps achieve this without making the attribute name too long.
For example `name-product-short` clearly indicates that the attribute resolves.
It is also not product specific, which might be usitable for
