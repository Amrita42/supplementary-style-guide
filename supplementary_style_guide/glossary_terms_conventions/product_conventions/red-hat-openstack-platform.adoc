==== image:images/yes.png[yes] OpenStack services (noun)

* On the first use of the component name in a module, write the code name in lowercase in parentheses after the component name and after _service_.

Examples of correct usage: _Networking service (neutron)_, _Shared File Systems service (manila)_, _Identity service_, _OpenStack Networking service_.
