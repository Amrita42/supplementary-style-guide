[[action]]
==== action (noun)
*Description*: In the context of authorization in OpenShift, an action consists of _project_, _verb_, and _resource_.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:project[project], xref:verb[verb], xref:resource[resource]

[discrete]
[[api-objects]]
==== API objects (noun)
*Description*: API objects are the resources that can be exposed by an API server
at an endpoint for interrogation.

For general references to a term that is also an API object, use lower case and separate multi-word API objects. For example:

* pod
* node
* daemon set
* config map

Example general term usage: _You must have at least one secret, config map, or service account._

However, if you are interacting with the API object, such as when defining or editing an object, use the proper PascalCase `Kind` for the object and mark it up in monospace. For example:

* `Pod`
* `Node`
* `DaemonSet`
* `ConfigMap`

Example object-specific usage: _The default amount of CPU that a container can use if not specified in the `Pod` spec._

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:api-server[API server], xref:endpoint[endpoint]

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:endpoint[endpoint]

[discrete]
[[application]]
==== application (noun)
*Description*: Although the term _application_ is not an specific API object type
in OpenShift, customers still create and host applications on OpenShift, and
using the term within certain contexts is acceptable. For example, the term
application might refer to some combination of an image, a Git repository, or a
replication controller, and this application might be running PHP, MySQL, Ruby,
JBoss, or something else.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

[[custom-resource]]
==== custom resource (noun)
*Description*: A custom resource (CR) is a resource implemented through the Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition` API. While CRs have the same behaviors as the built-in set of Kubernetes and OpenShift resources, CRs are added either manually or by installing Operators. Therefore, CRs might not be available on all clusters by default. Every CR is part of an API group.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*:

[discrete]
[[custom-resource-definition]]
==== custom resource definition (noun)

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*:

[discrete]
[[deployment]]
==== deployment (noun)
*Description*: A statement of intent by a user to roll out a new version of a configuration. To avoid confusion, do not refer to an overall OpenShift installation, instance, or cluster as an "OpenShift deployment".

The API object for a deployment can be either a Kubernetes-native `Deployment` object (which uses replication controllers) or an OpenShift-specific `DeploymentConfig` object (which uses replica sets).

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: deployment configuration

*See also*: xref:api-objects[API objects]

[discrete]
[[dockerfile]]

*Description*: An image is a pre-built, binary file that contains all of the necessary components to run a single container; a container is the working instantiation of an image. Additionally, an image defines certain information about how to interact with containers created from the image, such as what ports are exposed by the container. OpenShift uses the same image format as Docker; existing Docker images can easily be used to build containers through OpenShift. Additionally, OpenShift provides a number of ways to build images, either from a Dockerfile or directly from source hosted in a Git repository.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*:

[discrete]
[[kubernetes-master]]
==== Kubernetes master (noun)
*Description*: The Kubernetes-native equivalent to the OpenShift master. An OpenShift system runs OpenShift masters, not Kubernetes masters, and an OpenShift master provides a superset of the functionality of a Kubernetes master, so it is generally preferred to use the term OpenShift master.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:openshift-master[OpenShift master]

[discrete]
[[label]]
==== label (noun)
*Description*: Objects used to organize, group, or select API objects. For example, pods are "tagged" with labels, and then services use label selectors to identify the pods they proxy to. This makes it possible for services to reference groups of pods, even treating pods with potentially different containers as related entities.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*:

[[okd]]
==== OKD (noun)
*Description*: The name of OpenShift's open source, upstream project (previously known as
OpenShift Origin before August 3, 2018). OKD is a distribution of Kubernetes
optimized for continuous application development and multitenant deployment.
Officially, the initialism does not stand for anything.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: O.K.D., okd, OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution, OpenShift Origin

*See also*:

[discrete]
[[openshift]]
==== OpenShift (noun)
*Description*: The OpenShift product name should be paired with its product
distribution / variant name whenever possible. For example:

- OpenShift Container Platform
- OpenShift Online
- OpenShift Dedicated
- OpenShift Kubernetes Engine

Previously, the upstream distribution was called OpenShift Origin, however it is
now called OKD; use of the OpenShift Origin name is deprecated.

Avoid using the name "OpenShift" on its own when referring to something that
applies to all distributions, as OKD does not have OpenShift in its name.
However, the following components currently use "OpenShift" in the name and are
allowed for use across all distribution documentation:

- OpenShift Ansible Broker (deprecated in 4.2 / removed in 4.4)
- OpenShift Pipeline
- OpenShift SDN

*Use it*: yes, as described above

[discrete]
[[openshift-container-registry]]
==== OpenShift Container Registry (noun)
*Description*: The integrated container registry that is deployed as part of an OpenShift Container Platform installation. This container registry adds the ability to easily provision new image repositories. This allows users to automatically have a place for their builds to push the resulting images. OpenShift Container Platform has an installation option that allows you to have the OpenShift Container Registry deployed, but with none of the other build options enabled.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:container-registry[container registry], xref:red-hat-container-catalog[Red Hat Container Catalog]

[discrete]
[[openshift-master]]
==== OpenShift master (noun)
*Description*: Provides a REST endpoint for interacting with the system and manages the state of the system, ensuring that all containers expected to be running are actually running and that other requests such as builds and deployments are serviced. New deployments and configurations are created with the REST API, and the state of the system can be interrogated through this endpoint as well. An OpenShift master comprises the API server, scheduler, and SkyDNS.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:endpoint[endpoint], xref:api-server[API server], xref:scheduler[scheduler]

[discrete]
[[openshift-origin]]

[[operator-openshift]]
==== Operator
See xref:operator[Operator] in the _General Conventions_ part.

[discrete]
[[pod]]
==== pod (noun)
*Description*: Pods come from the Kubernetes concept of the same name. A pod is a set of one or more containers deployed together to act as if they are on a single host, sharing an internal IP, ports, and local storage. It is important to realize that OpenShift treats pods as immutable. Any changes, be it the underlying image, `Pod` configuration, or environment variable values, cause new pods to be created and phase out the existing pods. Being immutable also means that any state is not maintained between pods when they are recreated. The API object for a pod is `Pod`.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:container[container], xref:api-objects[API objects]

[discrete]
[[project]]
==== project (noun)

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:action[action]

[discrete]
[[quick-start]]
==== quick start (noun)
*Description*: Two types of quick starts exist in OpenShift:

* Quick starts that provide a guided tutorial in the web console.
* Quick start templates that enable users to start creating new applications quickly.

Ensure that you provide context about which type of quick start you are referring to.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: quickstart, Quickstart

==== replication controller (noun)
*Description*: A Kubernetes object used to ensure a specified number of pods for an application are running at a given time. The replication controller automatically reacts to changes to deployed pods, both the removal of existing pods (deletion, crashing, etc.) or the addition of extra pods that are not desired. The pods are automatically added or removed from the service to ensure its uptime.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:
