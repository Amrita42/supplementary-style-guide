[[api-objects]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] API objects (noun)
*Description*: API objects are the resources that can be exposed by an API server
at an endpoint for interrogation.

For general references to a term that is also an API object, use lower case and separate multi-word API objects. For example:

* pod
* node
* daemon set
* config map

Example general term usage: _You must have at least one secret, config map, or service account._

However, if you are interacting with the API object, such as when defining or editing an object, use the proper PascalCase `Kind` for the object and mark it up in monospace. For example:

* `Pod`
* `Node`
* `DaemonSet`
* `ConfigMap`

Example object-specific usage: _The default amount of CPU that a container can use if not specified in the `Pod` spec._

*Use it*: yes

[discrete]
[[application]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] application (noun)
*Description*: Although the term _application_ is not an specific API object type in OpenShift Container Platform, customers still create and host applications on OpenShift Container Platform, and using the term within certain contexts is acceptable. For example, the term application might refer to some combination of an image, a Git repository, or a replication controller, and this application might be running PHP, MySQL, Ruby, JBoss, or something else.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:app[app]

[discrete]

[[custom-resource]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] custom resource (noun)
*Description*: A custom resource (CR) is a resource implemented through the Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition` API. Although CRs have the same behaviors as the built-in set of Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform resources, CRs are added either manually or by installing Operators.

[[image]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] image (noun)
*Description*: An image is a pre-built, binary file that contains all of the necessary components to run a single container; a container is the working instantiation of an image. Additionally, an image defines certain information about how to interact with containers created from the image, such as what ports are exposed by the container. OpenShift Container Platform uses the same image format as Docker; existing Docker images can easily be used to build containers through OpenShift Container Platform. Additionally, OpenShift Container Platform provides a number of ways to build images, either from a Dockerfile or directly from source hosted in a Git repository.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*:

[[kubernetes-master]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] Kubernetes master (noun)
*Description*: The Kubernetes-native equivalent to the OpenShift master. An OpenShift system runs OpenShift masters, not Kubernetes masters, and an OpenShift master provides a superset of the functionality of a Kubernetes master, so it is generally preferred to use the term OpenShift master.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:openshift-master[OpenShift master]

[discrete]
[[label]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] label (noun)
*Description*: Objects used to organize, group, or select API objects. For example, pods are "tagged" with labels, and then services use label selectors to identify the pods they proxy to.

[[okd]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] OKD (noun)
*Description*: The name of the open source, upstream project of OpenShift Container Platform (previously known as

*Incorrect forms*: O.K.D., okd, OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution, OpenShift Origin

*See also*:

[discrete]
[[openshift]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] OpenShift (noun)
*Description*: The OpenShift product name should be paired with its product
distribution or variant name whenever possible. For example:

- OpenShift Container Platform
- OpenShift Online

- OpenShift Kubernetes Engine

Previously, the upstream distribution was called OpenShift Origin, however it is
now called OKD; use of the OpenShift Origin name is deprecated.

Avoid using the name "OpenShift" on its own when referring to something that
applies to all distributions, as OKD does not have OpenShift in its name.
However, the following components currently use "OpenShift" in the name and are
allowed for use across all distribution documentation:

- OpenShift Ansible Broker (deprecated in 4.2 / removed in 4.4)
- OpenShift Pipeline
- OpenShift SDN

*Description*: The integrated container registry that is deployed as part of an OpenShift Container Platform installation. This container registry adds the ability to easily provision new image repositories. With OpenShift Container Registry users can automatically have a place for their builds to push the resulting images. OpenShift Container Platform has an installation option you can use to have the OpenShift Container Registry deployed, but with none of the other build options enabled.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:container-registry[container registry], xref:red-hat-container-catalog[Red Hat Container Catalog]

[discrete]
[[openshift-master]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] OpenShift master (noun)
*Description*: Provides a REST endpoint for interacting with the system and manages the state of the system, ensuring that all containers expected to be running are actually running and that other requests such as builds and deployments are serviced. New deployments and configurations are created with the REST API, and the state of the system can be interrogated through this endpoint as well. An OpenShift master comprises the API server, scheduler, and SkyDNS.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

See xref:operator[Operator] in the _General Conventions_ part.

[discrete]
[[pod]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] pod (noun)
*Description*: Pods come from the Kubernetes concept of the same name. A pod is a set of one or more containers deployed together to act as if they are on a single host, sharing an internal IP, ports, and local storage. OpenShift Container Platform treats pods as immutable. Any changes to the underlying image, `Pod` configuration, or environment variable values, cause new pods to be created and phase out the existing pods. Being immutable also means that any state is not maintained between pods when they are recreated. The API object for a pod is `Pod`.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:container[container], xref:api-objects[API objects]

[discrete]
[[project]]

[[replication-controller]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] replication controller (noun)
*Description*: A Kubernetes object that ensures a specified number of pods for an application are running at a given time.
