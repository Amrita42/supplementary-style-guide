[[domain-controller]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] domain controller (noun)
*Description*: A domain controller (DC) is a host that responds to security authentication requests within a domain and controls access to resources in that domain. IdM servers work as DCs for the IdM domain. A DC authenticates users, stores user account information and enforces security policy for a domain. When a user logs into a domain, the DC authenticates and validates their credentials and either allows or denies access.

[[gssapi]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] GSSAPI (noun)
*Description*: The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI, or GSS-API) allows developers to abstract how their applications protect data that is sent to peer applications. Security-service vendors can provide GSSAPI implementations of common procedure calls as libraries with their security software. These libraries present a GSSAPI-compatible interface to application writers who can write their application to use only the vendor-independent GSSAPI. With this flexibility, developers do not have to tailor their security implementations to any particular platform, security mechanism, type of protection, or transport protocol.

Kerberos is the dominant GSSAPI mechanism implementation, which allows Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Microsoft Windows Active Directory Kerberos implementations to be API compatible.

*Use it*: yes

[discrete]
[[hidden-replica]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] hidden replica (noun)
*Description*: A hidden replica is an IdM replica that has all services running and available, but its server roles are disabled, and clients cannot discover the replica because it has no SRV records in DNS.

Hidden replicas are primarily designed for services such as backups, bulk importing and exporting, or actions that require shutting down IdM services. Since no clients use a hidden replica, administrators can temporarily shut down the services on this host without affecting any clients.

[discrete]
[[id-mapping]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] ID mapping (noun)
*Description*: SSSD can use the SID of an AD user to algorithmically generate POSIX IDs in a process called _ID mapping_. ID mapping creates a map between SIDs in AD and IDs on Linux.

* When SSSD detects a new AD domain, it assigns a range of available IDs to the new domain. Therefore, each AD domain has the same ID range on every SSSD client machine.
* When an AD user logs in to an SSSD client machine for the first time, SSSD creates an entry for the user in the SSSD cache, including a UID based on the user's SID and the ID range for that domain.
* Because the IDs for an AD user are generated in a consistent way from the same SID, the user has the same UID and GID when logging in to any Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.


*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

*See also*: xref:id-ranges[id ranges], xref:sssd[SSSD]

[discrete]
[[id-ranges]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] ID ranges (noun)
*Description*: An ID range is a range of ID numbers assigned to the IdM topology or a specific replica. You can use ID ranges to specify the valid range of UIDs and GIDs for new users, hosts and groups. ID ranges are used to avoid ID number conflicts. There are two distinct types of ID ranges in IdM:

* _IdM ID range_
+
Use this ID range to define the UIDs and GIDs for users and groups in the whole IdM topology. Installing the first IdM server creates the IdM ID range. You cannot modify the IdM ID range after creating it. However, you can create an additional IdM ID range, for example when the original one nears depletion.

* _Distributed Numeric Assignment (DNA) ID range_
+
Use this ID range to define the UIDs and GIDs a replica uses when creating new users. Adding a new user or host entry to an IdM replica for the first time assigns a DNA ID range to that replica. An administrator can modify the DNA ID range, but the new definition must fit within an existing IdM ID range.


Note that the IdM range and the DNA range match, but they are not interconnected. If you change one range, ensure you change the other to match.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

[discrete]
[[id-views]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] ID views (noun)

  * Define different attribute values for different environments.
  * Replace a previously generated attribute value with a different value.

In an IdM-AD trust setup, the `Default Trust View` is an ID view applied to AD users and groups. Using the `Default Trust View`, you can define custom POSIX attributes for AD users and groups, thus overriding the values defined in AD.

[[idm-server-and-replicas]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] IdM server and replicas (noun)
*Description*: To install the first server in an IdM deployment, you must use the `ipa-server-install` command.

Administrators can then use the `ipa-replica-install` command to install *replicas* in addition to the first server that was installed. By default, installing a replica creates a replication agreement with the IdM server from which it was created, enabling receiving and sending updates to the rest of IdM.

There is no functional difference between the first server that was installed and a replica. Both are fully functional read/write IdM servers.

[[kerberos-keytab]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] Kerberos keytab (noun)
*Description*: While a password is the default authentication method for a user, keytabs are the default authentication method for hosts and services. A Kerberos keytab is a file that contains a list of Kerberos principals and their associated encryption keys, so a service can retrieve its own Kerberos key and verify a user’s identity. For example, every IdM client has an `/etc/krb5.keytab` file that stores information about the `host` principal, which represents the client machine in the Kerberos realm.

[[static-delta]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] static-delta (noun)
*Description*: Updates to OSTree images are always delta updates. In case of RHEL for Edge images, the TCP overhead can be higher than expected due to the updates to number of files. To avoid TCP overhead, you can generate static-delta between specific commits, and send the update in a single connection. This optimization helps large deployments with constrained connectivity.

[[ticket-granting-ticket]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] ticket-granting ticket (noun)
*Description*: After authenticating to a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC), a user receives a ticket-granting ticket (TGT), which is a temporary set of credentials that can be used to request access tickets to other services, such as websites and email.
You can use a TGT to request further access, and provide the user with a Single Sign-On experience, as the user only needs to authenticate once in order to access multiple services. TGTs are renewable, and Kerberos ticket policies determine ticket renewal limits and access control.

[[web-server]]
==== image:images/yes.png[yes] web server (noun)
*Description*: A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests for web content, such as pages, images, or applications.
