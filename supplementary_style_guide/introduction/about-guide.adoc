= About this guide

[IMPORTANT]
**This document is a work in progress.**

This guide provides style guidelines and preferred term usage for link:https://www.redhat.com/[Red Hat] product and cross-product solution documentation. It is intended to be used as a supplement to _The IBM Style Guide_, which is the primary source of guidance.

// TODO: Mention that this should be referenced before the ibm style guide as it overrides some of the existing guidance

This guide was created by the Red Hat Customer Content Services team, who is responsible for producing product documentation for Red Hat customers. It may also be used by upstream communities who want to align more closely with the standards used by Red Hat product documentation.
